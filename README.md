# Async Console Game

This project is an example of a console game developed using the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module to draw all animations.

## Currently implemented

* Drawing randomly placed blinking stars
* Drawing animated spaceship
* Drawing spaceship's gun shot
* Movement the spaceship using the arrow keys on the keyboard

## Quickstart

Then open a terminal window and execute the command:

```bash

$ python game.py

```

As a result, a game scene will appear in the terminal window.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the spaceship.

To exit the game, you must press the key combination **CTRL+C**.
